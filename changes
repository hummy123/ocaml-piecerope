# 0.9.1 (2023-03-22)
* Proper handling of \r\n line breaks.
* Additional line break tests.
* Piece_rope.stats function now returns proper number of lines (previously returned 0 if there were no line breaks; now returns 1 if there are no line breaks but just text because a single line without a line break is still a line).

# 0.9.0 (2023-03-16)
* Implementation of functionality in mind is done but I might change my mind later.
