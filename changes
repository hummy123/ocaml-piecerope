# 0.9.1 (2023-03-22)
* Piece_rope.stats function now returns proper number of lines.
* More robust handling of \r\n line breaks.
  * If trying to insert in midle of \r\n, insert is moved to after this pair.
  * If either \r or \n is deleted in \r\n pair, deletes both.
  * If trying to retrieve line that ends with \r\n, returns the \r\n pair at the end.
  * If trying to retrieve line after a \r\n pair, now returns the line after the pair (previously returned \n at the start).
* Additional unit tests to verify proper functioning.

# 0.9.0 (2023-03-16)
* Implementation of functionality in mind is done but I might change my mind later.
